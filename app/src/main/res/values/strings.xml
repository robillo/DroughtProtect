        <item>By checking the water level of a particular area we can help farmers deciding the best
            crop suited for their farm
            ● Datasets required will be of past ground water level of various location which is
            available easily
            ● Show the water level with the help of graphs and need not be interactive
            ● Now from the water level data find the crops which are suitable for that particular
            ground water level, application should show suggestion of crops best suited for that
            water level
            ● If possible create a window in which the get a map of india and when the user zoom
            into selected areas he can get the water level and the crops suitable for that
            particular region,
            else just create the the ground water level graph for regions in which the major farming
            happens in india,
            like punjab, deccan plateau and north-east side
        </item>
        <item>The application should be able to predict the occurrence of flood by previous data,
            and flood prediction should be limited to flood prone areas
            ● Datasets required here will be of past flood data of various regions and water level
            of water bodies located in the flood prone areas
            ● Use heatmaps to show flood prone areas
        </item>
        <item>We can see how the wildlife of a particular area gets affected when a drought or flood
            happens in that particular area
            ● We will need wildlife data of various regions of india before and after flood/drought
            ● Create map of various regions and show how the wildlife gets affected by any
            means suitable
        </item>
        <item>We can show how aquatic life of a region gets affected when drought happens, how lake
            and ponds dry off and all the aquatic life gets extinct
            ● We will need data of aquatic life data of drought prone areas
            ● Like wild life just show the after effects of drought on aquatic life of that region
            ● Find the water bodies of that regions and make the comparisons
        </item>
        <item>So this is a bit complex because I am not sure if it is possible to predict it,
            but we can just show that chances of forest fire increased when the dryness in the air
            increases
            ● We will need dataset of air condition of a particular region
            ● Just highlight the areas which are prone to forest fire
        </item>
        <item>Just like water level check by soil quality checker we can help farmers to know the
            soil of their land better,
            we can check the quality of soil of area and then with the help of this data we can
            check the crop best suited for that type of soil
            ● Finding dataset for this is quite tricky as it is very difficult to find region wise
            soil composition and quality all
            we can have is the state wise soil quality so if we are unable to get the data of region
            just show the crops which are best
            suited for that particular state
            ● Don’t make a seperate window for this
        </item>
        <item>The main focus of the application, we shall see the previous trends of drought and
            find the occurrence of next one
            ➔ Right now we are still searching for various algorithm and datasets, some features
            which could help are atmospheric pressure,
            topography, soil moisture, land surface processes, interaction between air, land and
            ocean
        </item>
        <item>We will display heatmaps for nearly all states in India that will indicate most
            drought-prone areas in India.
        </item>
